# [VCL](https://vcl.github.io/) button

The main control for triggering actions.

## Features

Two dimensional modifiers for variant and state.
Variants like: _emphasized_, _transparent_ etc.
States like: _disabled_, _pressed_, _hovered_, _selected_ etc.

## Usage

### Basic

Buttons can be created using the `button`, `a` and
`input` tags while the first is to be preferred.

[basic example](/demo/example-basic.html)

A button can appear to be disabled through `disabled` class and/ or
`disabled` attribute.

The default and outline variant support a selected state via `selected` as well.

[selected example](/demo/example-selected.html)

If text exceeds the button's width, the text is cut off and does not break
into a new line. With the `overflow-ellipsis` modifier and
ellipsis is shown.

[overflow-label example](/demo/example-overflow-label.html)

The label of a button is generally build with an _icogram_,
by virtue of which it supports labels with prepended and appended icons.

Button sizes can be changed with scaling modifiers from the
size-modulation component.
