# [VCL](https://vcl.github.io/) token-input

Multiple item input based on tokens.

## Features

Combines the an input (via `input`), token and a plain HTML input to
a multi-item-select input control.
The control supports wrapping of tokens into multiple lines.

## Usage

[basic example](/demo/example-basic.html)

To make the `input` container appear to be focused, the
`focused` modifier has to be applied if the nested input is focused.

Tokens wrap if they don't fit on one line making the input element
higher.
