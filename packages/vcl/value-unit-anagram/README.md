# [VCL](https://github.com/vcl/doc) value-unit-anagram

The combination of value(s) with associated unit(s) in any permutation.

## Features

The `vu-anagram` is similar to the _icogram_ component;
it is a wrapper for `value` and `unit`
which can occur in arbitrary order and count.
The unit can also be an _icon_ component.
The value-unit-anagram applies a small gap in form of a margin
between the elements.

## Usage

Basic usage.

[basic example](/demo/example-basic.html)

The following examples show permutations of value and unit,
varied font size for the value and the use of an icon as unit.
