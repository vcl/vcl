Besides just a set of independent buttons, a button group can function as
toggle button group.
Such a group may allow for selection of a single button (radio button like)
as the following.

With the possibility to select multiple ones, a button group forms a
check box like group.

A horizontally justified layout can be realized with the properties of the
layout component.

Using layout classes, the items can be justified. Using modifiers for the buttons
can also be used.
