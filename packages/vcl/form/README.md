# [VCL](https://github.com/vcl/doc) form

Basic form layout and arrangement of form elements with labels.

## Features

### Form Control Group

The concept of a control group with `form-control-group` which groups an
input element together with a label and a hint so that they make up an atomic control.
For example a label and an input if such a combination should behave
like a single control. The elements are aligned vertically.
