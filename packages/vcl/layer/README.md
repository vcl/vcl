# [VCL](https://vcl.github.io/) layer

Show content or dialogs on top of the current view.

## Features

Introduces the following concepts:

- Layer cover: the fix positioned background covering the viewport to indicate
  that the underlying content cannot be interacted with.
- Layer: The fixed positioned container of the layer box, used to lay out the
  layer box.
- Layer box: The relative positioned container holding the actual content of
  the layer.

By default the layer box is horizontally and vertically centered.

The layer box has a reasonable max width; it
extends to covers the whole viewport if its width
is smaller than `$sm-viewport`.

## Usage

Usually a layer is opened in context of the current view to show additional
information or allow for additional interactions.

A simple layer with a panel as its content.

[basic example](/demo/example.html)

Utilize the `fade-out-animation` with the `layer-cover` and `layer` to create a smooth entry and exit animation.

[Dynamic modal with entry and exit transition](/demo/example-with-transitions.html)

Utilize the `zoom-animation` to create *zoom in* and *zoom out* effect when the modal opens and closes.
