# [VCL](https://vcl.github.io/) file-input

File input for selecting one or multiple files via tap and drag-and-drop
gestures.

## Features

A dragged-over sensitive input control that is typically used in drag-and-drop
scenarios such as file upload inputs. At the same time it can be focused
and and the main action triggered with the same gestures like applicable to
 a button.

Modifiers for the following available states:
_dragndrop_, _busy_, _error_, _warning_, _success_, _focused_, _disabled_.

## Usage

[basic example](/demo/example-basic.html)

### Sizing

The same properties as for the the _input_ module apply. The difference is that
the default height is higher to serve as a proper drop target.

### Validation

The validation state of an file input can be visualized by the standard modifiers
`error`, `warning` and `success`.
